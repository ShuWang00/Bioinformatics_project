# Introduction
•	They hypothesized that distinct cells-of-origin may play a role in determining ovarian tumor phenotype and outcome. 
•	they describe a new cell culture medium for in vitro culture of paired normal human ovarian (OV) and fallopian tube (FT)    epithelial cells from donors without cancer. 
•	These cells have been cultured individually for short periods of time, this is the first long-term culture of both cell types from the same donors. 
•	Do analysis of the gene expression profiles of the cultured OV/FT cells 
•	identified a normal cell-of-origin gene signature that classified primary ovarian cancers into OV-like and FT-like subgroups; 
•	the normal cell-of-origin may be a source of ovarian tumor heterogeneity and the associated differences in tumor outcome.
